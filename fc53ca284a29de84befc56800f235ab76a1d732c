- Updated to 2.2.2.
- Release 1.
- Removed "pl" patch.
- BuildRequires: libxml2-devel.
- Added new languages: Azerbaijani, Latvian, Maltese and Xhosa (???).
- Redefined _htmldir to match rest of kde*.
- Corrected FindLang() so it uses %{_htmldir}.
  NOTE: this package is not intended to be placed on FTP, but it is usable
  for individuals who need localized KDE (and have 0.6GB to build
  it).
